# README

This repository contains the code, materials, and manuscript for the simulation
study **"Latent Variables Moderated Mediation Using Correct and Misspecified
Models"** by Felipe Fontana Vieira and Yves Rosseel.

The study compares three estimators of a latent moderated-mediation model under
varying sample size, reliability, exogenous-predictor distribution, and structural
misspecification:

- **LSAM** — local structural-after-measurement, `lavaan::sam(sam.method = "local", se = "local")`
- **LMS** — latent moderated structural equations, `modsem::modsem_da(method = "lms", robust.se = TRUE)`
- **UPI** — extended unconstrained product indicators (double mean-centering), `modsem::modsem(method = "dblcent", estimator = "MLR")`

The design is a full factorial of 4 sample sizes × 3 interaction effects × 2
reliabilities × 5 distributions × 9 misspecifications = 1080 conditions, each run
for 800 replications.

## Repository Structure

The project consists of a set of R scripts forming a four stage pipeline, plus a
Quarto manuscript and a Nix environment definition.

### 1. Simulation

```
.
├── gen_env.R          # generates default.nix via {rix} (pinned R + packages + Quarto + TeX)
├── default.nix        # generated environment definition (built with nix-shell)
├── calibration/
│   ├── calibrate.R                 # calibrates misspecification coefficients & residual variances
│   ├── calibration_explanation.qmd # full derivation of the calibration scheme
│   └── calibration_results.rds     # output (copied to results/calibration.rds for the sim)
├── sim_mc.R           # main driver: builds the design grid and runs all conditions in parallel
└── helpers_mc.R       # data generation, the three estimators, MC/Wald inference, admissibility
                       #   checks, and the per-replication / per-condition workers (sourced by sim_mc.R)
```

The simulation writes its outputs to `results/`:

```
results/
├── calibration.rds          # calibration lookup consumed by sim_mc.R
├── design.rds               # the 1080-row design grid
├── estimates_mc.rds         # combined per-fit estimates (~1.3 GB, ~47M rows)
├── metrics_mc.rds           # combined per-replication fit metrics / timings
├── summary.rds              # performance metrics      (← analyze_mc.R)
├── rejection_imm_a3.rds     # Type I error / power     (← analyze_mc.R)
└── convergence_report.rds   # convergence & outlier counts (← analyze_mc.R)
```

The per-condition files `condition_mc_0001.rds … condition_mc_1080.rds` (one
per condition, written by `sim_mc.R` for resumability) are intermediate
artifacts combined into `estimates_mc.rds` at the end of Step 1, and are *not
included* in this repository.

The large combined outputs in `results/` are archived on Zenodo (DOI above) 
rather than committed here. Download them into `results/` to re-run 
`analyze_mc.R`. 

### 2. Analysis and figures

```
.
├── analyze_mc.R       # results/estimates_mc.rds → summary / rejection / convergence tables
└── figures.R          # results/{summary,rejection_imm_a3}.rds → plots/*.png (14 figures)
```

### 3. Manuscript

```
manuscript/
├── article.qmd        # paper source (APA 7 via the apaquarto extension)
├── references.bib     # bibliography
├── article.pdf        # rendered output (also built on push by .github/workflows/render.yaml)
└── _extensions/       # vendored apaquarto extension
```

The manuscript embeds the figures from `plots/` directly (via
`knitr::include_graphics`).

## Workflow

The pipeline runs in three stages, each consuming the previous stage's output.
Calibration (`calibration/calibrate.R`) is a prerequisite whose result is
already provided in `results/calibration.rds`.

### Step 1: Run the simulation

```r
Rscript sim_mc.R
```

`sim_mc.R` builds the design grid (`results/design.rds`), reads
`results/calibration.rds`, and runs every condition in parallel via
`parallel::mclapply` with reproducible `L'Ecuyer-CMRG` streams (master seed
`1234`). Each condition is saved to `results/condition_mc_<id>.rds` as it
completes (so the run is **resumable**), then all are combined into
`results/estimates_mc.rds` and `results/metrics_mc.rds`.

### Step 2: Process results and build figures

```r
Rscript analyze_mc.R    # → results/{summary,rejection_imm_a3,convergence_report}.rds
Rscript figures.R       # → plots/*.png
```

`analyze_mc.R` applies the two convergence criteria (soft / strict), removes
outliers, and computes performance metrics with Monte Carlo standard errors.
`figures.R` turns those tables into the 14 paper figures.

### Step 3: Render the manuscript

```sh
quarto render manuscript/article.qmd    # → manuscript/article.pdf
```

### Data flow

```

## Cloning this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/felipelfv/simulation_modmid
cd simulation_modmid
nix-shell        # builds the pinned environment from default.nix
```

The environment is fully pinned with [Nix](https://nixos.org/). `default.nix` is
generated by `gen_env.R` (using the `{rix}` package) and fixes the R version, all
R packages, the Quarto CLI, and the LaTeX dependencies to a single snapshot
(nixpkgs date `2026-05-11`), with `lavaan` and `modsem` built from specific GitHub
commits. To regenerate the environment definition:

```r
Rscript gen_env.R    # requires the {rix} package; rewrites default.nix
```

The same environment is used by the GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/render.yaml`), which rebuilds it and re-renders the manuscript
on every push to `main`.

## Reproducing the simulation

Running `sim_mc.R` (Step 1) requires the following packages, all pinned in
`default.nix`. Parallelism uses base R's `parallel`.

| Package | Version | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| modsem | 1.0.21 (git `6a1ed1b`) | Slupphaug, Mehmetoglu & Mittner (2025) |
| lavaan | 0.7.1.2759 (git `337e951`) | Rosseel, Jorgensen & De Wilde (2026) |
| covsim | 1.1.0 | Grønneberg, Foldnes & Marcoulides (2022) |
| rvinecopulib | 0.7.3.1.0 | Nagler & Vatter (2025) |

## Reproducing the results

Running `analyze_mc.R` and `figures.R` (Step 2) requires:

| Package | Version | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| dplyr | 1.2.1 | Wickham, François, Henry, Müller & Vaughan (2026) |
| simhelpers | 0.3.1 | Joshi & Pustejovsky (2025) |
| ggplot2 | 4.0.3 | Wickham (2016) |
| tidyr | 1.3.2 | Wickham, Vaughan & Girlich (2025) |

The environment itself is generated with `{rix}` 0.18.2 (Rodrigues & Baumann,
2026). Versions above are those resolved by the pinned environment under R 4.5.1.
